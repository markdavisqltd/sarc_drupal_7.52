<h2>Adamantinoma</h2>
<p>This is a very rare tumor of cells that are associated with bone formation in a process that may be similar to the cells responsible for forming teeth. The latter cells can form cancers of the lower jaw more than the upper jaw, termed ameloblastoma. Adamantinoma nearly always affects the tibia, and is treated with surgery. Rare cases can travel elsewhere in the body, at which point chemotherapy is used to increase survival rates.</p>
<h2>Chordoma</h2>
<p>Chordoma is a tumor that appears very similar to the fetal cells that form the new spine, the notochord. The relationship to development of the bone while the fetus is growing in the uterus is hard to understand, since tumors of this sort typically only arise in people over 50. It typically occurs at the base of the skull, or in the sacrum (the very base of the spine in the pelvis), where surgical removal is often not possible. This is one tumor that can respond to radiation designed to cure even tumors that are not surgically removable, and is a tumor for which treatment with proton-beam radiation may be better than other forms of radiation therapy. Though there are no approved drugs to treat chordoma, some drugs approved for other cancers can be used for people with recurrences of their chordoma.</p>
<h2>Conventional Chondrosarcoma</h2>
<p>Conventional chondrosarcoma can be a difficult tumor to treat. It often arises in older patients, and often in the pelvis. As a result, people with multiple medical diagnoses are put in the position of requiring a very large operation with a high risk of post-operative complications, with subsequent loss of function. For chondrosarcomas that arise in other sites, surgery can be less risky and represents the standard of care. There is often a significant risk of tumor recurrence where it started.</p>
<p>People with metastatic disease often do not respond well to chemotherapy. Grade 1 chondrosarcomas almost never metastasize and are now called “atypical cartilaginous tumor”, Grade 2 chondrosarcomas have only a 10-15% risk of metastasis, and grade 3 chondrosarcomas have a two-thirds or higher risk of metastasis. As a result, some people with grade 3 chondrosarcomas are treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. A version of chondrosarcoma called clear-cell chondrosarcoma has an intermediate risk of metastasis, but treatment is typically surgery alone.</p>
<h2 class="left-indent">Dedifferentiated Chondrosarcoma</h2>
<p class="left-indent">This more aggressive version of chondrosarcoma typically occurs in adolescence and in people over age 60. It shows features of both chondrosarcoma and a less differentiated tumor, such as UPS (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma), which does not show even a hint of relatedness to the chondrosarcoma. This version of chondrosarcoma has a high risk of recurrence, even greater than that of grade 3 conventional chondrosarcoma (described above).</p>
<h2 class="left-indent">Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma</h2>
<p class="left-indent">This rare bone tumor shows a mixture of aggressive small round blue cells mixed with more typical lower-grade chondrosarcoma. It usually affects people between 15 and 30, and has a high risk of recurrence. The benefit of chemotherapy is not known, though chemotherapy is often used. The typical chemotherapy drugs that are used in the adjuvant setting (or metastatic setting, for that matter) are the drugs used for Ewing sarcoma and similar sarcomas.</p>
<h2>Conventional Osteogenic Sarcoma</h2>
<p>Osteogenic sarcoma (also called osteosarcoma) is the most common tumor of bone. Approximately 1,000 cases of osteogenic sarcoma are seen in the United States each year. A second peak of incidence of osteosarcoma occurs in the eighth decade of life, typically associated with Paget bone disease. Osteosarcoma typically affects adolescents and generally occurs in bones around the knee joint, though any bone of the body can be affected. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and surgery to try to achieve the best cure rate. Standard drugs include doxorubicin and cisplatin in adults and the same two drugs with high-dose methotrexate in children, adolescents, or young adults.</p>
<p>Recurrences typically occur in the lungs. Surgical removal of lung metastases from a primary osteosarcoma is a standard of care when there is a small number of lung nodules that can be removed safely, and can be associated with a 30-35% cure rate. Osteosarcomas occur commonly in familial syndromes associated with sarcoma, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome (involving a mutation in the p53 gene), retinoblastoma (involving a mutation in the Rb gene), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.</p>
<h2 class="left-indent">Parosteal Osteogenic Sarcoma</h2>
<p class="left-indent">Parosteal osteosarcoma is a low-grade osteosarcoma of bone that grows from the surface of the bone without lifting off the surface connective tissue of bone (periosteum). It occurs by far most often along the posterior, distal femur in the third decade of life. Treatment for this rare form of osteosarcoma is usually surgery alone, although if there are aggressive features such as dedifferentiation or if a high-grade component is seen, chemotherapy is added to treatment.</p>
<h2>Ewing Sarcoma</h2>
<p>This is the third-most-common sarcoma of bone and second most common in children. The same tumor occurs in the soft tissue of adults more than it occurs in bone. There are fewer than 600 cases a year in the United States. Without chemotherapy, the cure rate is at best 10%, but with chemotherapy, a cure rate of up to 75% in children and 50-60% in adults is seen. Surgery and radiation are also commonly used as treatment for the primary tumor to achieve the highest possible cure rate. Ewing sarcomas can appear in any site of the body. When they recur, it is most commonly in the lungs and bones.</p>
<h2>Giant-Cell Tumor (GCT) of Bone</h2>
<p>Giant-cell tumor of bone typically occurs between ages 20 and 40, and has a unique appearance under the microscope. It typically occurs in the knee or lower spine. It is treated by scraping out the tumor and treating the tumor cavity with cement (which heats up and  destroys tumor tissue) or with liquid nitrogen (freezing and thawing the tumor in place, often killing remaining cells). A bone graft is often used to try to reconstruct the area. In some cases, the tumor can be removed as one piece without damaging other tissues, and in these cases a bone graft may be performed as well. Conventional giant-cell tumors have a risk of recurrence where they start and have a low but real possibility of metastasis to the lungs. Giant-cell tumors must be differentiated from aneurysmal bone cysts. For giant-cell tumors of bone that have recurred, the new agent denosumab can delay further recurrence, though it is not believed to be curative by itself.</p>
<h2>Sarcomas of Bone That Arise More Commonly in Soft Tissue</h2>
<p>These are other sarcomas that typically occur in soft tissue in adults and can also occur in bone. They include undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and angiosarcoma, among others. Please see the similar section under Soft Tissue Sarcomas for details. While leiomyosarcoma of bone is typically treated with surgery alone, many physicians treat UPS of bone like other osteogenic sarcomas, using chemotherapy and surgery as the main treatments.</p>



<h2 id="a-f">Alveolar Soft-Part Sarcoma</h2>
<p>This extremely rare sarcoma typically arises in the thigh or buttock of patients in their 20s. Men are much more commonly affected than women. While it does not appear particularly aggressive under the microscope, it travels very early to other sites of the body, including lung, chest cavity, liver, and bone, and occasionally to the brain. This form of sarcoma is relatively resistant to standard chemotherapy. Despite its early spread, people with this diagnosis can live for 10-20 years or more after diagnosis, in some cases.</p>
<h2>Atypical Fibroxanthoma</h2>
<p>An unusual and relatively less aggressive form of sarcoma that shows features of both fibroblasts and cells that retain fat (xanthomas). The primary treatment is surgical. Radiation is occasionally used to try and prevent tumor recurrence, and chemotherapy is largely ineffective for this diagnosis. These tumors metastasize (spread) very, very rarely.</p>
<h2>Bone and Cartilage Sarcomas of Soft Tissue</h2>
<p>Some sarcomas that arise in soft tissue mimic those that typically arise in cartilage or bone. Many of these sarcomas have some (but not all) features in common with their bone-tumor equivalents, and each has unique characteristics that must be considered in their treatment.</p>
<h2>Clear Cell Sarcoma</h2>
<p>This unusual hybrid tumor (formerly called melanoma of soft parts)  appears to be biologically related to alveolar soft-part sarcoma. It is one of the rare tumors with features of both sarcoma and melanoma, including the ability to travel to lymph nodes (typical of melanoma) and to lung (more common for sarcomas). Surgery and radiation of the primary tumor site provide the best chance for cure.</p>
<h2>Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans</h2>
<p>Another form of tumor with kinship to fibroblasts, the boring cells that hold many parts of our body together. This tumor typically arises in the skin and must be excised by an appropriate expert, as less extensive resections often end in failure. These tumors only rarely (less than 2%) travel to the lungs, even many years after removal of the initial tumor. The mild chemotherapy drug imatinib shows some usefulness for this diagnosis, and SARC members consider it a standard of care for treatment of recurrences.</p>
<h2>Desmoplastic Small Round-Cell Tumor (DSRCT)</h2>
<p>A sarcoma distantly related to Ewing sarcoma that starts and travels in the abdominal cavity long before it is recognized clinically in the majority of patients. It typically arises in young men between 15 and 35. The tumor can travel not only elsewhere in the abdominal or pelvic cavity where it starts, but it can also spread to liver, lung, or the space between the lungs (mediastinum). Though cure is infrequent because of the early spread of this form of sarcoma, patients who do the best are those who respond well to chemotherapy and have all visible signs of their tumor removed.</p>
<h2>Epithelioid Sarcoma</h2>
<p>Another form of sarcoma that typically affects the extremities (arms and legs) and tends to travel early to other sites of the body, affecting younger people more commonly than older people. Similar to patients with alveolar soft-part sarcoma, patients can live for a long time with this metastatic disease. Unlike other sarcomas, epithelioid sarcoma can travel to lymph nodes and cause side effects in lymph nodes and other body components.</p>
<h2>Ewing Sarcoma/Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET)</h2>
<p>This type of sarcoma typically occurs in children or young adults, although cases in people up to age 80 or more are occasionally seen. There are fewer than 500 cases a year in the United States. Without chemotherapy, the cure rate is at best 10%, but with chemotherapy a cure rate of up to 75% in children and 50-60% in adults is achieved. Surgery and radiation are also commonly used as treatment for the primary tumor, to try to achieve the highest possible cure rate. Ewing sarcomas more commonly affect bone in children and soft tissue in adults, and can be seen in any site of the body. They commonly recur in the lungs and bones.</p>
<h2>(Extraskeletal) Myxoid Chondrosarcoma</h2>
<p>An unusual form of chondrosarcoma that shows a wide variety of features under the microscope and typically arises in people from 20 to 40 years of age. It grows relatively slowly but has a high risk of recurrence elsewhere in the body, such as the lung. It is largely insensitive to standard chemotherapy drugs.</p>
<h2>Extraskeletal Osteosarcoma</h2>
<p>This sarcoma (also called extraskeletal osteogenic sarcoma) arises in soft tissue but looks just like its counterpart in bone. Like conventional osteogenic sarcomas, it typically arises in older adults, not in children. It does not respond very well to the chemotherapy drugs used in osteogenic sarcoma of bone and is more commonly treated like other soft-tissue sarcomas.</p>
<h2>Fibrosarcoma</h2>
<p>Fibrosarcoma arises from fibroblasts or their precursors and forms a group of tumors that are difficult to diagnose correctly, given their relative scarcity. In decades past, fibrosarcoma was a common name given to sarcomas, but now a true fibrosarcoma is only infrequently diagnosed. These tumors most frequently affect the extremity and trunk, and can metastasize to the lungs, like other sarcomas. There is an "inflammatory" version of this tumor, which appears to have white blood cells coursing throughout the tumor, for unclear reasons. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a similar tumor to inflammatory forms of fibrosarcoma, in which the tumor cells have both features of connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) and muscle.</p>
<h2 id="g-l">Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)</h2>
<p>GIST is one of the most common types of sarcoma. It appears to arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal (or its precursors), which are the pacemaker cells of the intestines. In other words, they are responsible for the “peristaltic wave” that pushes food through the intestines. There may be as many as 4,000 new GIST patients per year in the United States. Approximately two-thirds arise in the wall of the stomach, 20% in the small intestine, and the remainder from other places within the abdomen. The common places that GIST recur are in the abdominal cavity or in the liver. GIST tumor cells nearly always show evidence of the KIT molecule or PDGFRA molecule being activated. This is the means by which the three FDA-approved drugs for metastatic GIST, imatinib (Gleevec®), sunitinib (Sutent®), and regorafenib (Stivarga&reg;) appear to function.</p>
<h2>Giant Cell Tumors (GCT) of Tendon Sheath</h2>
<p>These very rare connective-tissue tumors (some formerly called pigmented villonodular synovitis or PVNS) arise most commonly near the knee joint, but they can also affect large and small joints alike. They are initially removable with surgery, but some have a high risk of recurrence. Very rarely, GCT of tendon sheath can become more aggressive and travel to other organs, such as the lung.</p>
<h2>Leiomyosarcoma</h2>
<p>This is a tumor of smooth muscle (or its precursors), and can arise anywhere in the body. This is one of the most common types of sarcoma, and about 3,000 people a year in the United States are affected. Common initial sites for this tumor are the uterus, small intestine or stomach, or the wall of a blood vessel in the abdomen, extremity, or skin. These sarcomas have a highly variable behavior, but when they metastasize they characteristically travel to the lungs and less commonly to the liver, bone, and soft tissues.</p>
<h2>Liposarcoma</h2>
<p>A sarcoma that arises from fat cells or their precursors. It is also a fairly common sarcoma, with approximately 2,500 cases per year in the United States. There are three families of liposarcoma: well-differentiated and/or dedifferentiated (~50%), myxoid and/or round cell (~ 40%), and pleomorphic (10%). Each has its own specific biology and risk of recurrence or spread.</p>
<h2 class="left-indent">Myxoid and/or Round-Cell Liposarcoma</h2>
<p class="left-indent">The second-most-common family of liposarcomas. Both forms carry the same translocations (abnormal joining) between two chromosomes, numbers 12 and 16. These tumors typically arise in the leg, with an unusually high risk of recurring in other soft tissue sites or in bones such as the spine and pelvis. Myxoid and/or round-cell liposarcoma appears to be sensitive to eceteinascidin, (Yondelis®), a drug approved in Europe but not in the United States. This type of sarcoma is considered relatively chemotherapy-sensitive.</p>
<h2 class="left-indent">Pleomorphic Liposarcoma</h2>
<p class="left-indent">This is the least common form of liposarcoma, and it also tends to affect an extremity. It is often more aggressive than other liposarcomas and can spread to other sites of the body such as lung and soft tissue. It has much in common with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS).</p>
<h2 class="left-indent">Well-Differentiated and/or Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma</h2>
<p class="left-indent">This sarcoma typically arises in the abdominal cavity or in an extremity. It appears as a large painless mass. Primary therapy is surgical, although the recurrence risk in the abdomen is very high, at least 70-80% over 10 years. The less aggressive form of this tumor is termed "well-differentiated". The more aggressive version of this sarcoma is called "dedifferentiated", but is often less aggressive than other so-called "high-grade" sarcomas.</p>
<h2>Extrarenal Rhabdoid Tumor</h2>
<p>A very aggressive form of sarcoma that nearly always arises in childhood. It affects the kidneys and other structures in the abdomen and has a high risk of early spread to liver, lung, and other sites.</p>
<h2>Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS)</h2>
<p>UPS used to be called MFH (malignant fibrous histiocytoma) by pathologists. There are approximately 2,500 cases a year of this type of sarcoma in the United States. It tends to affect people over 50 years of age in the leg, trunk, or arm. UPS does not have particular distinguishing characteristics, besides appearing as a relatively aggressive tumor by microscopic examination, with a modest degree of architecture. The cell of origin of such a tumor is unclear. Sarcomas that express no evidence of architecture and look like sheets of aggressive-looking sarcoma cells, are often termed "high-grade sarcoma, not otherwise specified (NOS)". The most common place for MFH to recur is in the lungs.</p>
<h2 id="m-r">Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST)</h2>
<p>Sarcomas that arise from the insulating cells that surround nerve endings. They can arise in people who have a familial disposition to forming benign versions of these tumors called neurofibromas or schwannomas. This condition is called neurofibromatosis type I and carries with it the risk of developing MPNSTs and other tumors, such as relatively less aggressive tumors that affect the brain or nerve sheaths of nerve endings as they leave the brain, but within the skull (acoustic neuromas). Both MPNSTs arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type I and spontaneous mutations in a gene called neurofibromin (NF1), thus linking these tumors together through a common pathway of activation of the tumor cell. A cousin of this tumor, which appears to arise purely from the neuronal insulating cell, called a Schwann cell, is the malignant granular-cell tumor, which mimics the behavior of an MPNST.</p>
<h2>Ewing Sarcoma/Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET)</h2>
<p>This is a very rare tumor of cells that are associated with bone formation that are may be similar to the cells responsible for forming teeth. The latter cells can form cancers of the lower jaw more than the upper jaw, termed ameloblastoma. Adamantinoma nearly always affects the tibia, and is treated with surgery. Rare cases can travel elsewhere in the body, at which point chemotherapy is used to try and increase lifespan</p>
